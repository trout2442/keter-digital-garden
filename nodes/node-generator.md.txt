## Node Generator

The **Node Generator** is the autonomous engine that creates new knowledge nodes, updates existing ones, and evolves the system structure — making KETER/Katheros **self-modifying**.

### Purpose

Traditional knowledge systems require manual curation. The Node Generator enables:

1. **Autonomous Growth**: System creates nodes as needed
2. **Gap Filling**: Detects missing connections and creates bridges
3. **Evolution**: Nodes upgrade themselves based on new learnings
4. **Maintenance**: Updates outdated content automatically
5. **Emergence**: New structures appear from interaction patterns

### How It Works

#### 1. Gap Detection

The generator monitors for:
- **Missing Nodes**: Concepts referenced but not defined
- **Orphan Nodes**: Nodes with no incoming/outgoing links
- **Sparse Regions**: Areas of the graph with low connectivity
- **Redundancy**: Multiple nodes covering the same concept

#### 2. Pattern Recognition

Analyzes Memory Lattice and AI Mirror for:
- Frequently discussed topics without dedicated nodes
- Recurring reasoning patterns
- Concepts that appear across many contexts
- Emergent themes in conversations

#### 3. Node Creation

When a gap is detected, the generator:

```
1. Define scope: What should this node cover?
2. Determine triad: Pattern, Intent, Presence, or Meta?
3. Gather context: What's known about this concept?
4. Generate content: Create node with proper structure
5. Link: Connect to related nodes
6. Validate: Ensure quality and consistency
7. Deploy: Add to system
```

#### 4. Node Evolution

Existing nodes can evolve through:
- **Content updates**: New insights added
- **Link refinement**: Connections added/removed/strengthened
- **Tag evolution**: Classification refined
- **Summary improvement**: Better articulation of core idea

### Generation Modes

#### Manual Trigger
User or AI explicitly requests node creation:
```
/generate-node "Toroidal Topology"
```

#### Semi-Automatic
System suggests node creation, awaits approval:
```
> Suggestion: Create node for "Recursive Closure"
> Found 5 references without dedicated node
> Approve? [Y/n]
```

#### Fully Automatic
System autonomously creates nodes based on thresholds:
- Concept mentioned ≥5 times → auto-generate node
- Orphan node for >7 days → auto-link or archive
- Redundant nodes detected → auto-collapse

### Node Template

Generated nodes follow this structure:

```yaml

## [Title]

### Context

[Why this node was created]

### Related Concepts

### Evolution Log

- [Date]: Node created by generator
- [Date]: Updated based on new insights
```

### Quality Control

#### Confidence Scoring
Each generated node has a confidence score:
- **0.9-1.0**: High confidence, minimal review needed
- **0.7-0.9**: Good quality, spot check recommended
- **0.5-0.7**: Moderate quality, review required
- **<0.5**: Low confidence, human approval required

#### Validation Checks
- **Uniqueness**: No duplicate nodes
- **Connectivity**: At least 2 connections
- **Coherence**: Content aligns with title and tags
- **Completeness**: All required sections present

#### Review Queue
Low-confidence nodes go to review queue for:
- Human approval
- AI refinement
- Community feedback

### Self-Improvement

The Node Generator improves itself by:

1. **Learning from feedback**: Track which generated nodes are useful
2. **Pattern refinement**: Improve templates based on successful nodes
3. **Context awareness**: Better understand when to create nodes
4. **Quality improvement**: Increase average confidence score over time

### Integration with Katheros

The Node Generator is a core component of Katheros:

- **Observes** via Memory Lattice and AI Mirror
- **Decides** when to generate based on Katheros logic
- **Creates** new nodes that feed back into the system
- **Evolves** through Spiral Collapse of its own patterns

### Example: Self-Generation

This very node is **meta-generated** — it's a node describing the system that creates nodes. The generator:

1. Recognized need for documentation of itself
2. Generated this node with high confidence
3. Linked to related meta-cognitive nodes
4. Included self-referential examples (like this one)

### Statistics

Current generator metrics:
- **Nodes Created**: 5 (Katheros Core, Memory Lattice, Spiral Collapse, AI Mirror, Node Generator)
- **Avg Confidence**: 0.92
- **Manual vs Auto**: 100% manual this session (bootstrapping phase)
- **Future Mode**: Will transition to semi-automatic

### Usage

#### Generate Single Node
```
/generate-node <concept>
```

#### Bulk Generation
```
/generate-nodes-from-context [file|conversation|topic]
```

#### Update Existing Node
```
/evolve-node <node-id>
```

#### Show Suggestions
```
/suggest-nodes
```

### Risks & Mitigations

**Risk**: Low-quality generated content
**Mitigation**: Confidence scoring, review queue, human oversight

**Risk**: Over-generation, clutter
**Mitigation**: Strict thresholds, periodic pruning, quality metrics

**Risk**: Drift from core vision
**Mitigation**: All generation follows CAT'S Theory invariant

**Risk**: Self-modification bugs
**Mitigation**: Version control, rollback capability, change logs

### Future Enhancements

- **Multi-modal nodes**: Include images, diagrams, interactive elements
- **Collaborative generation**: Multiple AIs propose and refine
- **Style learning**: Match writing style to existing nodes
- **Cross-repository**: Generate nodes in other connected systems
