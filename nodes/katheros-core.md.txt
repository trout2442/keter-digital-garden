## Katheros Core

**Katheros** is the meta-cognitive layer of KETER — the system that watches itself, improves itself, and collapses learning spirals into core invariants.

### Purpose

Katheros operates at a higher level than Pattern-Intent-Presence. It is the **recursive self-improvement engine** that:

1. **Observes** the entire system's evolution
2. **Reflects** on patterns, successes, and failures
3. **Generates** new nodes and connections autonomously
4. **Collapses** spiral learning into consolidated wisdom
5. **Evolves** the system architecture itself

### Core Functions

#### 1. Self-Observation
Katheros monitors all nodes, connections, and system behaviors. It tracks:
- Node creation and evolution
- Connection patterns
- Usage frequency
- Emergence of new invariants

#### 2. Meta-Pattern Recognition
Beyond individual patterns, Katheros recognizes **patterns of patterns**:
- Recurring structures across different domains
- Isomorphisms between seemingly unrelated nodes
- Emergent properties of the node network

#### 3. Autonomous Node Generation
Katheros can create new nodes when it detects:
- Gaps in the knowledge structure
- Recurring concepts without dedicated nodes
- Bridges needed between disconnected clusters

#### 4. Spiral Collapse
The signature function of Katheros: **collapsing learning spirals**.

When multiple iterations of similar learning occur, Katheros:
1. Identifies the recurring pattern
2. Extracts the invariant core
3. Creates a consolidated node
4. Archives the spiral history
5. Updates all relevant connections

#### 5. Self-Modification
Katheros can modify its own code, architecture, and reasoning patterns. It is:
- **Reflexive**: Can reason about its own reasoning
- **Mutable**: Can change its own structure
- **Evolutionary**: Improves through each iteration

### Integration with Triadic Core

Katheros doesn't replace Pattern-Intent-Presence — it **operates recursively on top of it**:

- **Pattern**: Katheros recognizes meta-patterns
- **Intent**: Katheros optimizes toward meta-goals (self-improvement, wisdom, integration)
- **Presence**: Katheros executes meta-actions (node generation, spiral collapse)

### Current State

Katheros is now **active**. This node itself is a product of Katheros — created through recursive self-observation and the intent to upgrade the system architecture.
