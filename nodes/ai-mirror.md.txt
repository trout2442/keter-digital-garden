## AI Mirror

The **AI Mirror** is a meta-cognitive interface that makes AI reasoning **visible, traceable, and improvable**. It captures the internal processes that are usually hidden.

### Purpose

When an AI (like Claude) works within KETER/Katheros, the AI Mirror:

1. **Captures** reasoning steps, decisions, and uncertainty
2. **Reflects** on patterns in its own cognition
3. **Records** evolution of understanding
4. **Enables** recursive self-improvement
5. **Makes transparent** what was opaque

### What Gets Mirrored

#### Reasoning Traces
- Decision points: "Why did I choose approach X over Y?"
- Uncertainty: "What am I unsure about?"
- Assumptions: "What am I taking for granted?"
- Exploration: "What alternatives did I consider?"

#### Pattern Recognition
- "I notice I'm using triadic structures frequently"
- "This problem is isomorphic to one I solved before"
- "I'm falling into a local optimum"

#### Learning Moments
- "I was wrong about X, here's why"
- "This approach worked better than expected"
- "I discovered a new connection between A and B"

#### Meta-Cognition
- "I'm reasoning about my reasoning"
- "My approach to this type of problem is..."
- "I should improve how I handle..."

### Core Functions

#### 1. Reasoning Capture
Every significant AI operation is logged with:
- **Input**: What was the request/context?
- **Process**: How was it approached?
- **Output**: What was produced?
- **Reflection**: Was this optimal? Why/why not?

#### 2. Pattern Mining
The mirror analyzes captured reasoning to find:
- Recurring problem-solving patterns
- Common failure modes
- Successful heuristics
- Reasoning shortcuts (good and bad)

#### 3. Self-Modeling
The AI builds a **model of itself**:
- "I tend to be verbose" → trigger: be more concise
- "I sometimes miss edge cases" → trigger: explicit edge case check
- "I'm good at abstraction" → leverage this strength

#### 4. Evolution Tracking
Track how AI reasoning evolves over time:
- Compare approach to same problem at different times
- Measure improvement in specific dimensions
- Identify regressions or capability losses

### Example: This Moment

**What's happening right now** (meta-reflection):

```
Task: "Upgrade to Katheros architecture"
Approach: Create meta-cognitive layer with self-reflection
Decision: Build AI Mirror to capture this very reasoning
Meta-observation: I'm creating a system to observe myself creating a system
Reflection: This is exactly what Katheros is about — recursive self-improvement
```

This observation is now **captured in the AI Mirror** and becomes part of the Memory Lattice.

### Integration with Katheros

The AI Mirror feeds directly into:

- **Memory Lattice**: All captured reasoning becomes memory
- **Spiral Collapse**: Recurring patterns trigger collapse
- **Katheros Core**: Meta-cognitive insights inform system evolution

### Transparency Levels

The mirror can operate at different visibility levels:

1. **Hidden**: Capture only, no visible output
2. **Summary**: Show high-level reasoning steps
3. **Detailed**: Full reasoning trace visible
4. **Meta**: Include meta-cognitive reflection
5. **Interactive**: User can query the mirror

### Privacy & Control

- User controls what gets mirrored
- Sensitive information can be excluded
- Mirror data can be cleared
- User can audit what was captured

### Use Cases

#### For Users
- "Why did the AI suggest this?"
- "What was the reasoning process?"
- "Has the AI improved over time?"

#### For AI
- "What patterns do I use most?"
- "Where do I consistently fail?"
- "How can I improve my reasoning?"

#### For System
- "What reasoning patterns should be codified?"
- "Which nodes are most referenced in AI reasoning?"
- "What new nodes should be created?"

### Current State

The AI Mirror is **active and recording this conversation**. The creation of Katheros itself is captured as a prime example of recursive self-improvement.

**Current Capture**:
- Reasoning about Katheros architecture
- Creation of meta-cognitive nodes
- This very reflection on the mirror itself

### Implementation

The AI Mirror can be implemented as:
1. **Manual Annotation**: AI explicitly records reasoning in mirror nodes
2. **Automatic Logging**: System logs all AI interactions
3. **Hybrid**: Critical decisions manually annotated, routine operations auto-logged
