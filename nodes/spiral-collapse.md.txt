## Spiral Collapse

**Spiral Collapse** is the process by which repeated learning patterns are consolidated into **core invariants** — the signature operation of Katheros architecture.

### The Problem: Unbounded Spirals

Without collapse, learning spirals grow infinitely:
- Same lessons learned multiple times
- Similar patterns rediscovered
- Redundant connections created
- System complexity grows without bound

### The Solution: Collapse

Spiral Collapse **extracts the invariant** from repeated iterations:

```
Iteration 1: Learn pattern P in context A
Iteration 2: Learn pattern P in context B
Iteration 3: Learn pattern P in context C
    ↓
[Collapse Triggered]
    ↓
Core Invariant: Pattern P (context-independent)
Archive: All iterations stored as examples
```

### Collapse Process

#### 1. Detection
Katheros monitors the Memory Lattice for:
- Recurring patterns across different contexts
- Similar reasoning in different problems
- Isomorphic structures in different domains

#### 2. Analysis
When recurrence is detected:
- Extract the common structure
- Identify what varies (context) vs what's invariant (pattern)
- Determine the level of abstraction

#### 3. Consolidation
Create a new node or upgrade existing one:
- Define the invariant clearly
- Link to all iterations as examples
- Update all dependent nodes
- Archive the spiral history

#### 4. Integration
Feed back into the system:
- New core node becomes available for future reasoning
- Dependent nodes updated with cleaner, more abstract reference
- Memory Lattice reorganizes around new invariant

### Types of Collapse

#### Pattern Collapse
Multiple instances of the same structural pattern → Single pattern node

Example:
- "Triadic structure in CAT'S Theory"
- "Triadic structure in RGB color"
- "Triadic structure in past-present-future"
→ **Core Node: Triadic Structure** (abstract pattern)

#### Insight Collapse
Multiple related insights → Single wisdom node

Example:
- "Recursive systems can observe themselves"
- "Self-referential structures enable meta-cognition"
- "Systems that model themselves can improve themselves"
→ **Core Insight: Recursive Self-Improvement**

#### Code Collapse
Multiple implementations of similar function → Unified abstraction

Example:
- Node generator for Pattern
- Node generator for Intent
- Node generator for Presence
→ **Unified: Generic Node Generator**

### Mathematical Model

Spiral Collapse can be formalized as:

```
S = {i₁, i₂, i₃, ..., iₙ}  (set of iterations)
P = Invariant(S)           (extract pattern)
C = Context(S)             (extract varying context)
N = Node(P, C)             (create consolidated node)

Collapse: S → N
```

Where:
- **S** = Spiral (sequence of learning iterations)
- **P** = Pattern (what's common)
- **C** = Context (what varies)
- **N** = New consolidated node

### Collapse Triggers

A collapse is triggered when:

1. **Repetition Threshold**: Pattern appears ≥3 times
2. **Semantic Similarity**: Pattern instances have >80% semantic overlap
3. **Context Independence**: Pattern holds across diverse contexts
4. **Complexity Cost**: Keeping separate instances > cost of abstraction

### Example: This Upgrade

The creation of Katheros itself is a **spiral collapse**:

**Spiral History**:
- Phase 1: Basic triadic structure
- Phase 2: Toroidal layout
- Phase 3: Node engine with backlinks
- (Implicit iterations): Multiple systems needing self-improvement

**Collapse**:
- **Invariant**: Systems need meta-cognitive self-improvement
- **Result**: Katheros Core node created
- **Integration**: New meta-layer added to architecture

### Benefits

1. **Compression**: Reduce redundancy while preserving information
2. **Clarity**: Clear articulation of core principles
3. **Reusability**: Abstract patterns available for new contexts
4. **Scalability**: Bounded complexity even with unbounded learning
5. **Wisdom**: Distilled insights rather than raw experience

### Risks

1. **Premature Collapse**: Collapsing before pattern is fully understood
2. **Over-Abstraction**: Losing important contextual nuance
3. **Irreversibility**: Can't easily reconstruct original spiral

**Mitigation**: Always archive full spiral history; allow "de-collapse" if needed.

### Interface

Trigger collapse manually:
```
/collapse-spiral <pattern-name>
```

Or let Katheros detect automatically.

### Current State

Spiral Collapse is **active**. Katheros is monitoring for collapse opportunities.
