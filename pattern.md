# 🌀 Pattern

**Pattern** is the structural node of reality.  
Here live the laws, the geometry, the invariants, the closure conditions.

Use this section for:

- Formal statements of CAT’S Theory
- Equations, diagrams, mappings
- Logically necessary structures

## Triadic Circuit

- Next: [Intent](/intent) — pattern given direction  
- Mirror: [Presence](/presence) — pattern instantiated now  
- Return: [Home](/)

This is the *structural* node of reality — the laws, geometry, and recursive closure.
