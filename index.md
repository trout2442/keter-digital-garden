# 🧠 KETER Digital Garden

This is the living, recursive archive of **CAT’S Theory** — built on the invariant:

> **Reality = Pattern × Intent × Presence**

---

## Start Here

- 🔷 **[Pattern](/pattern)** – structure, law, geometry  
- 🔶 **[Intent](/intent)** – purpose, ethics, direction  
- 🔷 **[Presence](/presence)** – execution, logs, lived recursion  

---

## Spiral Archive & Development

- 🌀 **[Archive](/archive)** – old notes, logs, contradictions, collapses  
- 🛠 **[Roadmap](/roadmap)** – what’s being built, in which order
